                            Ocean Drive V2 is a Fivem roleplay server that is being developed by a that team exists out of a variety amount of talented people. 
                            <br><br>
                            FiveM is a modification for Grand Theft Auto V enabling you to play and create customized multiplayer servers.
                            <br><br>
                            The things that will make our server stand out among the other servers is that almost all of the scripts will be custom made. This will give us full control on what is happening, easily extend, deploy new features on the fly and maintain the server more easily which is really important to us. Also the community matters a lot to us because with out them we would not be doing this. We listen closely to our community and develop scripts based on their needs.
                            <br><br>
                            Our goal is to become the biggest roleplaying server among the Fivem community. We know this is a very ambitious goal but I believe it is possible due to our talented team. 
                            <br><br>
                            Ocean Drive V2 will be released somewhere in 2021 to the public.

                            The main focus of this project was to learn the basics of php, databases and learn how to work in a team using scrum.

                            Even though it is not the prettiest website I am very happy to show the result because the website contains all the functionality for the whole borrowing process to work and more.

                            School provided me with a basic c++ framework which was pretty slow (they made it slow on purpose) so I optimized it. Then all I had to do was create the game. I used a tool called Tiled to create levels and I load the levels using my own interpreter.

                            All of the sprites are inside of a spritesheet and are rendered effeciently using a technique called instancing. Collisions are being checked based on the tiles around you.

                            The challenge of this project was to have the AI behave as much like orignal game as possible.

                            Each AI behaves differently. They all have a unique movement and also start moving differently once some of their allies go down. For example they will move with more at the same time or group together and attack.

This game shows how much better it is for the enviroment when compared to a diesel car.

                            The main subject of the game had to be about reflection. So I came up with this puzzle/action game where you have to fight enemies and light up crystals to open doors.

                            You have crystals in a room that can be activated using your staff that shoots a laser. If you activate all of the crystals at the same time with your staff a door will open that is connected to those crystals. You can use the mirrors to have the laser from your staff reflect allowing you to hit multiple crystals at the same time.

                            Levels can be created using the level creator that I made as well.

                            The game is a tower defence game so you have to place towers and those towers will try to stop the enemies from passing by, by shooting at them. In the final wave of enemies a boss will appear.
