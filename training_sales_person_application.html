                    Training Sales Person Application is a Dutch application that I made together with an artist from my school during my internship at Capteur.
                    <br><br>
                    The application was made to learn sales associates about their products and how to respond to question from customers about those products.
                    <br><br>
                    The application is created in Unity using c#. We also made use of Azures cognitive services  to make the AI (customer) as smart as possible and have the conversation with the customer feel more real.

            This application has 3 different stages. The information stage, learning stage and exam.
            <br><br>
            Inside of the information stage you can select products and read their information. You can also practice some questions that you can receive from a customer.
            <br><br>
            The learning stage is basically a exam but instead of seeing the customer you have the product information in front of you.
            <br><br>
            Inside of the exam you are put in front of a customer who asks you questions about a product. You can hear the customer speak through a API called Text to Speech from Azure. You can then respond to the customer using your microphone. The application will translate your speech to text with a API from Azure called Speech to Text.
            <br><br>
            The text will be scanned for keywords and if you named those keywords that belong to that question your answer to the question will be seen as correct. The text is also getting graded by a Azure API based on if your responds is polite and positive.
            <br><br>
            A other feature of the application is that during the exam your face will be scanned by a camera that can see if you are smiling or looking angry etc.. This is also done by a API from Azure. 
            <br><br>
            So you get points for being nice and polite, smiling and giving the correct answers. Based on the amount of points you received during your exam you will pass or fail.
            <br><br>
            Some answers you give may not have the correct keywords in them even though the answer is correct and that is why there will also be a recording of you that a admin can watch and review as well.
            <br><br>
            A other fun feature is that the customers eye and mouth can move. The mouth only moves when the customer is talking.
