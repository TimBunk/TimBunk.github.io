                    My name is Tim Bunk I am 21 years old and I am a huge enthusiast when it comes to game or software development.
                    <br><br>
                    My official paper says that I have managed to secure my game-development degree and in 2023 I will receive my second degree in software-engineering. Unofficially, when the streets go dark, you'll often see me tinkering on games or software and/or brush up on current and new skills in these respective fields. Like most people in these fields, I love video games and movies.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, together with several years of projects that I did, have I created this website to advertise my game & software development portfolio to companies for an internship. Hit me up on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-bunk/">LinkedIn</a> if you like to continue our as of now one-sided conversation.
