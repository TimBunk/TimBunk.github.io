                        Ocean Drive V2 is a Fivem roleplay server that is being developed by a that team exists out of a variety amount of talented people. 
                        <br><br>
                        FiveM is a modification for Grand Theft Auto V enabling you to play and create customized multiplayer servers.
                        <br><br>
                        The things that will make our server stand out among the other servers is that almost all of the scripts will be custom made. This will give us full control on what is happening, easily extend, deploy new features on the fly and maintain the server more easily which is really important to us. Also the community matters a lot to us because with out them we would not be doing this. We listen closely to our community and develop scripts based on their needs.
                        <br><br>
                        Our goal is to become the biggest roleplaying server among the Fivem community. We know this is a very ambitious goal but I believe it is possible due to our talented team. 
                        <br><br>
                        Ocean Drive V2 will be released somewhere in 2021 to the public.

                Ocean drive already has already one roleplaying server which is known as Ocean Drive V1. This server exists out of community scripts and scripts that are edited by some of the developers in our team. The issue with this server is that the scripts don’t really work well together or the scripts miss features and are programmed poorly which leads to low fps on the client side.
                <br><br>
                That is why I started working on Ocean Drive V2. Currently it is just me working on V2 while the other people in the team maintain V1. I also have my cousin help me build V2 because he wants to learn how to program and work with databases. So I let him make some scripts and give him some tips on how to approach making those scripts and afterwards I will review his code and give him feedback.
                <br><br>
                After the main functionality is implemented in V2 the entire team will help me continue build the server. The main things that need to be done before the team can help me work on V2 are:
                <br>
                <ul style="margin-left: 3%">
                    <li> Code documentation </li>
                    <li> Guides for scripts </li>
                    <li> Database </li>
                    <li> Pipelining for the server </li>
                    <li> Some dev tools like flying around, teleporting etc. </li>
                    <li> Notifications </li>
                    <li> Chat system </li>
                    <li> Permissions system </li>
                    <li> Basic commands for kick, ban, grant [permission] etc. </li>
                    <li> Character creation </li>
                    <li> Character select </li>
                    <li> Shops – clothing, tattoo, food, pawn etc. </li>
                    <li> Inventory + trading + items </li>
                    <li> Phone + app system </li>
                    <li> Job system </li>
                    <li> Jobs - Police, doctor, garbage collector, delivery person etc. </li>
                    <li> Heists </li>
                    <li> Create races </li>
                    <li> Car dealer </li>
                    <li> Car customization </li>
                    <li> Custom key binding </li>
                    <li> Setup Tokovoip (for talking in game) </li>
                </ul>
                This is almost the complete list of all the high priority tasks. These need to be finished before we can release V2.
                <br><br>
                We work with scrum but do not apply the full methodology. We do this through Gitlab because with Gitlab you get free pipeline minutes and there is a tool for keeping track of issues and assign those issues too developers in the team.
                <br><br>
                So the way our Gitlab is structured is we have 2 branches and feature branches. First branch is the master branch which reflects the running version of the server. Second branch is the development branch, this is where features will be merged once they are finished. After a bunch of new features are in the development branch we have some community members test them and if everything seems good it will be merged with the master branch. Also all of the merge request will be reviewed by a team member to avoid bugs.
                <br><br>
                There are many people in our team with different nationalities and different roles in the team:
                <ul style="margin-left: 3%;">
                    <li> 3 people for support. They are most of the time the first to respond to tickets, manage the Discord and are active players in the server with rights like kick and ban.  </li>
                    <li> 4 hobbyist developers  </li>
                    <li> 2 developers with a degree in programming  </li>
                    <li> 1 artist  </li>
                    <li> 1 community manager  </li>
                    <li> 1 social media manager  </li>
                </ul>
                I will post more details like screenshots, videos and code samples on this page about this project when it is actually released.
